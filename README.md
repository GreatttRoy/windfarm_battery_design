# Windfarm Battery Design

大家好这里是卢嘉铭，欢迎来到我的github，第一篇开源的算法是我的毕业设计。这是我第一次开源，我想开源很久了，终于因为毕设开始了这第一步。希望这是我人生开源征途开始的一小步，而不是终章。 <br />
毕业设计的题目为“风电场储能运行方案设计”。 <br />
Hello everyone, this is Lu Jiaming. Welcome to my GitHub. The first open-source algorithm I'm sharing is my undergraduate graduation project. This is my first time contributing to open source, and I've wanted to do it for a long time. Finally, I am taking this first step with my graduation project. I hope this is just a small beginning of my journey in open-source, not the final chapter. <br />
The title of graduation design is "Wind farm energy storage Operation Scheme Design". <br />
